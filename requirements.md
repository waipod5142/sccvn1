✨ Project Brief Template:
I’m starting a web app called TravelPro, for adults that like organizing. The goal is to provide a platform that is a central hub for everything related to travel, users can manage itinerary, bookings, checklists, photo sharing, budgeting and other travel essentials. convert it to a concise project brief statement, and include the other travel essentials based on the industry.



✨ Sitemap Prompt:
based on the project brief, create a sitemap in plain text, showing all primary pages, their hierarchy, and how they are interconnected.

✨ UI Requirements Prompt:
give me a description of the ui structure for this home page, in plain text, from top to bottom. include only layout details and content blocks. don’t mention any styling or visual properties.
